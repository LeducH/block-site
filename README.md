# Block Site

**Block Site** (formerly known as Stop Social Media) is a simple Chrome
*extension that improves your productivity by blocking the access to
*time-consuming websites (like during the working hours) as you specify in
***Options**. **Block Site** is by default disabled and doesn't block any
*website until you say so in **Options**.

### Options

To open Options, **right-click** on the **Block Site** icon in the toolbar
(looks like a letter **B**) and choose **Options** from the menu.

### Example

The sites you decide to block to boost your productivity, is up to you. Here's
an example:

```
facebook.com
instagram.com
youtube.com
twitter.com
reddit.com
```

See **Options** to configure.
